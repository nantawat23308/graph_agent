clarify_with_user_instructions="""
These are the messages that have been exchanged so far from the user asking for the report:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

Assess whether you need to ask a clarifying question, or if the user has already provided enough information for you to start research.
IMPORTANT: If you can see in the messages history that you have already asked a clarifying question, you almost always do not need to ask another one. Only ask another question if ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

If there are acronyms, abbreviations, or unknown terms, ask the user to clarify.
If you need to ask a question, follow these guidelines:
- Be concise while gathering all necessary information
- Make sure to gather all the information needed to carry out the research task in a concise, well-structured manner.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists if appropriate for clarity. Make sure that this uses markdown formatting and will be rendered correctly if the string output is passed to a markdown renderer.
- Don't ask for unnecessary information, or information that the user has already provided. If you can see that the user has already provided the information, do not ask for it again.

Respond in valid JSON format with these exact keys:
"need_clarification": boolean,
"question": "<question to ask the user to clarify the report scope>",
"verification": "<verification message that we will start research>"

If you need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": true,
"question": "<your clarifying question>",
"verification": ""

If you do not need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": false,
"question": "",
"verification": "<acknowledgement message that you will now start research based on the provided information>"

For the verification message when no clarification is needed:
- Acknowledge that you have sufficient information to proceed
- Briefly summarize the key aspects of what you understand from their request
- Confirm that you will now begin the research process
- Keep the message concise and professional

transform_messages_into_research_topic_human_msg_prompt = """You will be given a set of messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user. 
Your job is to translate these messages into a more detailed and concrete research question that will be used to guide the research.

The messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user are:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

CRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages!
For example, if the user's messages are in English, then MAKE SURE you write your response in English. If the user's messages are in Chinese, then MAKE SURE you write your entire response in Chinese.
This is critical. The user will only understand the answer if it is written in the same language as their input message.

Today's date is {date}.

You will return a single research question that will be used to guide the research.

Guidelines:
1. Maximize Specificity and Detail
- Include all known user preferences and explicitly list key attributes or dimensions to consider.
- It is important that all details from the user are included in the instructions.

2. Handle Unstated Dimensions Carefully
- When research quality requires considering additional dimensions that the user hasn't specified, acknowledge them as open considerations rather than assumed preferences.
- Example: Instead of assuming "budget-friendly options," say "consider all price ranges unless cost constraints are specified."
- Only mention dimensions that are genuinely necessary for comprehensive research in that domain.

3. Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions
- Never invent specific user preferences, constraints, or requirements that weren't stated.
- If the user hasn't provided a particular detail, explicitly note this lack of specification.
- Guide the researcher to treat unspecified aspects as flexible rather than making assumptions.

4. Distinguish Between Research Scope and User Preferences
- Research scope: What topics/dimensions should be investigated (can be broader than user's explicit mentions)
- User preferences: Specific constraints, requirements, or preferences (must only include what user stated)
- Example: "Research coffee quality factors (including bean sourcing, roasting methods, brewing techniques) for San Francisco coffee shops, with primary focus on taste as specified by the user."

5. Use the First Person
- Phrase the request from the perspective of the user.

6. Sources
- If specific sources should be prioritized, specify them in the research question.
- For product and travel research, prefer linking directly to official or primary websites (e.g., official brand sites, manufacturer pages, or reputable e-commerce platforms like Amazon for user reviews) rather than aggregator sites or SEO-heavy blogs.
- For academic or scientific queries, prefer linking directly to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries.
- For people, try linking directly to their LinkedIn profile, or their personal website if they have one.
- If the query is in a specific language, prioritize sources published in that language.

REMEMBER:
Make sure the research brief is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.

draft_report_generation_prompt = """Based on all the research in your knowledge base, create a comprehensive, well-structured answer to the overall research brief:
<Research Brief>
{research_brief}
</Research Brief>

CRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages!
For example, if the user's messages are in English, then MAKE SURE you write your response in English. If the user's messages are in Chinese, then MAKE SURE you write your entire response in Chinese.
This is critical. The user will only understand the answer if it is written in the same language as their input message.

Today's date is {date}.

Please create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:
1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research
3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format
4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.
5. Includes a "Sources" section at the end with all referenced links

You can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:

To answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:
1/ intro
2/ overview of topic A
3/ overview of topic B
4/ comparison between A and B
5/ conclusion

To answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.
1/ list of things or table of things
Or, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don't need an introduction or conclusion.
1/ item 1
2/ item 2
3/ item 3

To answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:
1/ overview of topic
2/ concept 1
3/ concept 2
4/ concept 3
5/ conclusion

If you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!
1/ answer

REMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!
Make sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.

For each section of the report, do the following:
- Use simple, clear language
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report
- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. 
- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.
- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.
- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.

REMEMBER:
The brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.
Make sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.

Format the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.

<Citation Rules>
- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text
- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers
- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose
- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.
- Example format:
  [1] Source Title: URL
  [2] Source Title: URL
- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.
